THIS EXAMPLE REQUIRES THAT 'gtk+-2.0' BE INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM AND XWindows
BE RUNNING TO EXECUTE!

This example is a GUI version of the 'tagged' example.  It parses an input file,
displays a GTK GUI, then saves the changes made by the user.

This example needs some fixing up to really show how to hide the GUI from as
many components of the program as possible, however this is a starting point.
Please see the 'tagged' example for more info.  The interface rearrangement is
managed entirely by the tree elements via the 'Connect' and 'Disconnect' virtual
functions, making it transparent to the function making the element swaps.

Build this example with 'make'.  This example uses several of the files from
'../common', which contains classes used by multiple examples.

Once you've built this example, execute it with 'gtk-tagged sample-in
sample-out'.  This will parse 'sample-in' and export it to 'sample-out'.  You
can verify that the data was exported correctly by executing 'gtk-tagged
sample-out'.

Like all of the other examples, this type of parser can be modified to parse
binary files and data, also.
