This is the tagged example.  This example parses a file with a format similar to
XML.  The file contains a main section, which contains subsections, which can
contain other subsections, etc., or text.  Each section is preceded by an 'open'
tag and is followed by a 'close' tag.

Build this example with 'make'.  This example uses several of the files from
'../common', which contains classes used by multiple examples.

Once you've built this example, execute it with 'tagged sample-in sample-out'.
This will parse 'sample-in' and export it to 'sample-out'.  You can verify that
the data was exported correctly by executing 'tagged sample-out'.

To demonstrate erroneous data handling, change or remove parts of 'sample-in'.
The program should stop parsing upon encountering the error, however the parts
of the structure already assembled should be able to export a valid file which
can be correctly parsed (without the data following the error.)

Like the descriptor examples, this can be altered to parse binary data.  This
example uses 'tag-properties' from 'hparser' to manage the specific tag format
used in the input files; therefore, a binary implementation would have to
provide its own tag format and tag management.
