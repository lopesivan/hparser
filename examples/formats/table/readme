This is an example of a parser for files that hold a table of data at the
beginning and a bulk section of data after the table.  The table format is
similar to the first descriptor example and is parsed nearly identically.  Often
times this type of file will be used over a network so that the basic shell of
the file can be downloaded and each required part subsequently downloaded as
needed.  To simulate this process, the file manager also serves as an input
resource manager to allow each element to access its data.

Build this example with 'make'.  This example uses several of the files from
'../common', which contains classes used by multiple examples.

Once you've built this example, execute it with 'table sample-in sample-out'.
This will parse 'sample-in' and export it to 'sample-out'.  You can verify that
the data was exported correctly by executing 'table sample-out'.

Like all of the other examples, this type of parser can be modified to parse
binary files and data, also.
