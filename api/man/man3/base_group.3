.RI "\fIData importation manager\&.
.PP
This class is to manage the importation of an entire set of data\&. This should serve as a part of the base of a tree and should receive initial control of \fBdata_input\fP\&. Depending on the implementation, it should create the highest element (which should contain all other elements) and should allow the rest of the tree to self assemble using the \fBinput_receiver\fP functions receive_data and expand_data\&. \fP"

.RI "\fICombined input/output manager\&.
.PP
This is a convenience class for implementing both \fBinput_manager\fP and \fBoutput_manager\fP in the same object\&. \fP"

.RI "class \fBdata_exporter\fP"
.br
.RI "\fIData exportation manager\&.
.PP
This class is to manage the exportation of an entire set of data\&. This should serve as a part of the base of a tree and should receive initial control of \fBdata_output\fP\&. Depending on the implementation, it should pass control of output to its first element using the \fBoutput_sender\fP functions send_data and collect_data\&. \fP"

.PP
This class automates input of data for construction of a tree\&. \fP"

.RI "class \fBstructure_base\fP"
.br
.RI "\fIHierarchy base container\&.
.PP
This class serves as a simple base object for a hierarchy\&. It is the parent of the base element of the tree, and is therefore the base of the tree\&. \fP"
