.SH NAME
descriptor_input \- 
.PP
Input interface for descriptor-formated sections\&.
.PP
This class provides a simple interface for parsing data that uses a descriptor-style format (where each section's header contains all information pertaining to the section's size\&.) This interface must be combined virtually with an element class in order to be useful\&.

.SS "virtual \fBinput_receiver\fP* descriptor_input::receive_data (\fBdata_input\fP *)\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function is implemented to parse a section of data\&. It calls the functions of \fBmanaged_input\fP to determine whether or not a portion of data contains a sub-section and creates a new one if necessary\&. This process is repeated until the section is completely filled as indicated by section_complete\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBinput_receiver\fP\&.
.SS "virtual bool descriptor_input::section_complete (\fBdata_input\fP *) const\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [pure virtual]\fP"
This function is called internally to check to see if all data has been parsed for this section\&. The determination should be based on how much data has been parsed vs\&. how much data the descriptor indicated is in the section\&.
