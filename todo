**experiment with protocols for output

****-> write standard I/O classes (files already built)
***-> think out FILO class and rewrite it and TEST IT
+-> write a simple test to assemble a GTK GUI and to allow it to modify itself and export
	****->(rewrite from scratch)
*****-> update function docs with InsertNext and InsertChild
+-> proxy class
+-> connection control base class for ParentStorage

****NOTE: GUI changes all to made by derived classes (i.e. the objects themselves)

**-> combine plug-in, procsrv (rename), pmath, GUI into something wonderful
